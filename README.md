# Demo Platformer Level

This project is a **demonstration level** of a platformer game, designed to showcase my skills as a junior developer. It's a personal project where I implemented core gameplay mechanics, animations, and interactions to simulate a small but functional game world.

## üìñ Storyline

The protagonist finds themselves trapped in a virtual prison, a consequence of a failed attempt to track down the abductors of someone close. While exploring the digital environment, they discover a hidden path to freedom. The escape requires:

- Collecting four digits of a secret code.
- Activating a lever within a limited time window.
- Unlocking the hidden door behind the fountain.

But beware, the path is guarded by enemies, and every second counts!
